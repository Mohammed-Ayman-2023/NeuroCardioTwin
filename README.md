# NeuroCardioTwin
Our project, titled ”Integrated Neurovascular and Cardiovascular Monitoringsystem: A Digital Twin Approach”, focuses on developing a system that integrates critical neurovascular and cardiovascular metrics. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in monitoring vital parameters such as heart
rate, blood pressure, EEG (electroencephalogram), and NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy) in real-time. The problem we’re addressing is the need for a simple powerful tool that can simultaneously track and analyze these vital health metrics, especially in critical care settings. Often, existing tools only focus on either the cardiovascular or
neurovascular system separately, which might miss how these systems interact. For instance, issues in the heart can directly affect brain function, and vice versa. Our project aims to bridge this gap by providing a combined monitoring system that can offer early warnings if something goes wrong. he importance of this project lies in its potential applications in healthcare, particularly in critical care and personalized medicine. The digital twin
approach allows for continuous monitoring and analysis of key health metrics, which can be crucial for early detection of potential health issues such as strokes,
heart attacks, or other neurovascular and cardiovascular disorders.
